1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
ALDARA Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of:
•Clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adults. (1.1)
•Biopsy-confirmed, primary superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) in immunocompetent adults; maximum tumor diameter of 2.0 cm on trunk, neck, or extremities (excluding hands and feet), only when surgical methods are medically less appropriate and patient follow-up can be reasonably assured. (1.2)
•External genital and perianal warts/condyloma acuminata in patients 12 years or older. (1.3)
Limitations of Use: Efficacy was not demonstrated for molluscum contagiosum in children aged 2–12. (1.4, 8.4)
1.1 Actinic Keratosis
ALDARA Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adults.
1.2 Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma
ALDARA Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of biopsy-confirmed, primary superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) in immunocompetent adults, with a maximum tumor diameter of 2.0 cm, located on the trunk (excluding anogenital skin), neck, or extremities (excluding hands and feet), only when surgical methods are medically less appropriate and patient follow-up can be reasonably assured.
The histological diagnosis of superficial basal cell carcinoma should be established prior to treatment, since safety and efficacy of ALDARA Cream have not been established for other types of basal cell carcinomas, including nodular and morpheaform (fibrosing or sclerosing) types.
1.3 External Genital Warts
ALDARA Cream is indicated for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts/condyloma acuminata in patients 12 years or older.
1.4 Limitations of Use
ALDARA Cream has been evaluated in children ages 2 to 12 years with molluscum contagiosum and these studies failed to demonstrate efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
1.5 Unevaluated Populations
The safety and efficacy of ALDARA Cream in immunosuppressed patients have not been established.
ALDARA Cream should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions.
The efficacy and safety of ALDARA Cream have not been established for patients with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome or Xeroderma Pigmentosum.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE:
Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Ophthalmic Solution 1% or 1/8% is for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe, such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitis when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation, corneal injury from chemical, radiation, or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies.
Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Ophthalmic Solution, 1%, is recommended for moderate to severe inflammations, particularly when unusually rapid control is desired. In stubborn cases of anterior segment eye disease, systemic adrenocortical hormone therapy may be required. When deeper ocular structures are involved, systemic therapy is necessary.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Ophthalmic Solution 1% or 1/8% is for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe, such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitis when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation, corneal injury from chemical, radiation, or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies.
Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Ophthalmic Solution, 1%, is recommended for moderate to severe inflammations, particularly when unusually rapid control is desired. In stubborn cases of anterior segment eye disease, systemic adrenocortical hormone therapy may be required. When deeper ocular structures are involved, systemic therapy is necessary.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
ZOLADEX is a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist indicated for: 
•Use in combination with flutamide for the management of locally confined carcinoma of the prostate (1.1)
•Palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate (1.2)
•The management of endometriosis (1.3)
•Use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding (1.4)
•Use in the palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women (1.5)
1.1 Stage B2-C Prostatic Carcinoma
ZOLADEX is indicated for use in combination with flutamide for the management of locally confined Stage T2b-T4 (Stage B2-C) carcinoma of the prostate. Treatment with ZOLADEX and flutamide should start 8 weeks prior to initiating radiation therapy and continue during radiation therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)
and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
1.2 Prostatic Carcinoma
ZOLADEX is indicated in the palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].
1.3 Endometriosis
ZOLADEX is indicated for the management of endometriosis, including pain relief and reduction of endometriotic lesions for the duration of therapy. Experience with ZOLADEX for the management of endometriosis has been limited to women 18 years of age and older treated for 6 months [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and
Clinical Studies (14.3)].
1.4 Endometrial Thinning
ZOLADEX is indicated for use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4)].
1.5 Advanced Breast Cancer
ZOLADEX is indicated for use in the palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women. 
The estrogen and progesterone receptor values may help to predict whether ZOLADEX therapy is likely to be beneficial [see
Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1), and Clinical Studies (14.5)].
The automatic safety feature of the syringe aids in the prevention of needlestick injury.

1.2	Prostatic Carcinoma
ZOLADEX is indicated in the palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].
In controlled studies of patients with advanced prostatic cancer comparing ZOLADEX 3.6 mg to orchiectomy, the long-term endocrine responses and objective responses were similar between the two treatment arms. Additionally, duration of survival was similar between the two treatment arms in a major comparative trial. 
In controlled studies of patients with advanced prostatic cancer, ZOLADEX 10.8 mg implant produced pharmacodynamically similar effect in terms of suppression of serum testosterone to that achieved with ZOLADEX 3.6 mg implant. Clinical outcome similar to that produced with the use of the ZOLADEX 3.6 mg implant administered every 28 days is predicted with the ZOLADEX 10.8 mg implant administered every 12 weeks.
